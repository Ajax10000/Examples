    <title>3 Ways of Using CSS</title>
</head>

<body>
There are three ways you can use cascading stylesheets.
<ol>
    <li>
        Linked. Store your styles in a .css file and pull the file into your webpage with the 
        link tag. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Embedded. Place your styles at the top of your webpage within the head tag, in between the 
        &lt;style&gt; and &lt;/style&gt; tags.
    </li>
    <li>
        Inline. Place your styles directly on the element being styled, with the style attribute. 
        For example, here is one way you can center the text in a paragraph, and give the
        paragraph a yellow background, using the following: &lt;p style="text-align: center;
        background-color: yellow;"&gt;
        <p style="text-align: center; background-color: yellow">
            Hello everybody. I am text within a paragraph tag. I hope you can all see me, and 
            notice that I am centered. Not a fancy thing really. Note also that the background
            of this paragraph is yellow. 
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Method 1 is the preferred choice, as by modifying one file you update the style in 
    ll webpages that use that stylesheet. You can use multiple link tags to pull in 
    multiple external stylesheets. Keep in mind that if a style is specified twice, the 
    one in the link tag that was pulled in later will override the style that was specified 
    in the stylesheet pulled in with the first link tag.
</p>
<p>
    For example, suppose you are using two external stylesheets, named companyStyleDG102.css 
    and  companyStyleBA2045.css, both stored in a subfolder called css. Both of these 
    stylesheets have a style rule named .submitBtn. You then pull these external in the 
    following order:<br>
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/companyStleDG102.css"&gt;<br>
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/companyStyleBA2045.css"&gt;<br>
    Then the style named .submitBtn in companyStyleBA2045.css will override the style
    named .submitBtn in companyStyleDG102.css.
</p>
<p>
    Method 2 is not as preferred as 1, but is more preferrable than using method 3.
    Method 2 can be used to override styles brought in the external stylesheet via 
    the link tag. Just be sure to place your style tag <em>after</em> the link tag.
</p>
<p>
    Method 3 is not as preferred as methods 1 and 2. But it can be used to override 
    the styles used with methods 1 and 2. However, it is much harder to maintain the 
    styles by using method 3.
</p>
<p>
    However, you can also use more than one method, these methods are not mutually exclusive; 
    in fact, you could use all three methods for the same webpage if you wanted to.
