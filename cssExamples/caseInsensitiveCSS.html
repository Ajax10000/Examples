    CSS is not case sensitive when it comes to specifying property names. 
    Uncomment the embedded stylesheet rule in the head section to see that 
    even though we used property names like "backGROUND-COLOR" and "COLor",
    the property names are still processed correctly.
</p>
<p>
    CSS is case-insensitive when it comes to specifying element selectors, but is 
    case sensitive when specifying class and id selectors. For example, the following 
    two element selectors will all work. Notice we are using 'P' and not 'p' - either 
    one will work.
    <pre>
    P {
        background-color: white;
    }
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Notice we're using Div in the style below. We could have used div, DIV, diV, dIV, 
    etc. Anyone of them would have worked.<br>
    <pre>
    Div {
        margin-top: 20px;
    }
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    However, it is case-sensitive when it comes to class selectors and id selectors.
    The class names must match, and the id selectors must match as well. Consider the 
    snippet below:
    <pre>
    mytable {
        border: 1px solid black;
    }
    ...
    &lt;table class="myTable"&gt;
    </pre>
    This will not work as intended because "mytable" does not match "myTable". 
    The table will <strong>not</strong> have a solid black border 1px wide.
</p>
<p>
    Consider also the snippet below:
    <pre>
    #ChemData {
        float: left;
    }
    ...
    &lt;div id="chemData"&gt; 
    </pre>
    This will not work because "ChemData" does not match "chemData". So the 
    div tag with id="chemData" will <strong>notk</strong> be floated left.
