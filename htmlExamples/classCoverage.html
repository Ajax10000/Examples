    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>
        Week 1 focused on HTML5. The HTML5 elements we covered included &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, 
        &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, and 
        &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, and &lt;h6&gt;.
    </p>
    <p>
        The homework assignment for Week 1 focused on refactoring an existing web page.
    </p>

    <h3>First class of Week 1</h3>
    <p>
        The first class of week 1 had a long introduction by your Student Success Manager (SSM) 
        Michelle Bury. After that we focused on Git Bash (on Windows computers) or Terminal (on Macintosh
        computers) commands. These included the cd (change directory), ls (list files/folders), 
        pwd (print working directory), mkdir (make directory), rm (remove file or directory), 
        cp (copy file), and mv (move file), and touch (name of file to create).
    </p>
    <p>
        We then went into HTML and covered the &lt;DOCTYPE html&gt; tag, which indicates to the 
        browser that this is an HTML5 webpage. Other HTML5 elements covered included &lt;html&gt;, 
        &lt;head&gt;, &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;body&gt; elements.
    </p>

    <!-- ========================================================================================= -->
    <h3>Second class of Week 1</h3>
    <p>
        The second class of week 1 we had a Git demo. We covered the following git commands:
        <ul>
            <li>git clone .</li>
            <li>git origin pull master</li>
            <li>git status</li>
            <li>git add -A</li>
            <li>git commit -m "<em>message here</em>"</li>
            <li>git push origin master</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Also in the second class of week 1 you created a bio.html webpage and we covered some 
        CSS.
    </p>
</div>

    <!-- ========================================================================================= -->
    <h3>Third class of Week 1</h3>
    <p>
        The third class of week 1 we covered more CSS. In particular we covered floating, the box 
        model, and box model CSS properties: height, width, margin, border, and padding. We then went 
        on to cover the various types of positioning that CSS offered: static (the default position), 
        fixed, relative, and absolute. Then we covered reset stylesheets, which set all the default 
        styles of a browser to known defaults - this helped web browsers to display a given webpage the 
        same way. Finally we covered the z-index, to place division tags above or below each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may recall that you worked on an activity (CSS Positioned Activity) in which you had to 
        recreate a given webpage given an image of that webpage. The webpage used three div tags, one 
        using fixed position, one using relative position, and the last using absolute positioning. 
        There was a fourth div tag containing mostly lorem ipsum text.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another activity involved fixing the relative positioning in the href attribute of a link tag 
        so that the style.css file could be found.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- ######################################################################################### -->
<div id="week02">
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>
        Week 2 focused on Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and the BootStrap library.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- ######################################################################################### -->
<div id="week03">
    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <p>
        Week 3 focused on JavaScript. In summary, we covered:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>variable declaration statement (using var keyword)</li>
        <li>assignment statements (using = operator)</li>
        <li>if/else statements</li>
        <li>for loop statements</li>
        <li>while loop statements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The homework for week 3 focused on creating a password generator, given user 
        input as to what the password is allowed to contain.
    </p>
    <!-- ========================================================================================= -->
    <h3>First class of Week 3</h3>
    <p>
        First class of week 3 focused on the variables, variable declarations (with the <b>var</b> 
        keyword), and <strong>assignment statements</strong>, the assignment operator (=), alert function, 
        confirm function, and alert function, as well as the console.log function. We talked 
        about some JavaScript data types, including strings (like "Snow White" and 'Snow White'), 
        boolean values (true and false), as well as numbers. We also discussed that the 
        word "boolean" is named for George Boole, an English professor who taught in Ireland.
        Also covered the if/else statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this class we also talked about the + operator, and how it could be used as an 
        addition operator to add numbers, and as a string concatenation operator to 
        concatenate strings (i.e., take two strings and combine them into one string).
    </p>

    <!-- ========================================================================================= -->
    <h3>Second class of Week 3</h3>
    <p>
        Second class of week 3 focused on arrays, the for loop statement, and pseudocode.
        We also talked about the string object, and one of its methods, the toLowerCase()
        method. We also talked about the Math object, and two of it methods, Math.random() 
        and Math.floor().
    </p>
    <p>
        You also coded the Rock Paper Scissor (RPS) game, where you had the computer 
        generate a random number between 0 and 2, and used the random number as an index 
        into the array ["r", "p", "s"], and you also asked the user to provide his/her 
        input with a prompt pop-up (asking for "r", "p", or "s"). You then used an if/else 
        statement to determine who was the winner.
    </p>

    <!-- ========================================================================================= -->
    <h3>Third class of Week 3</h3>
    <p>
        Third class of week 3 focused on functions and object literals. We looked at the gandalf 
        and car object literals. Discussed how object literals are a series of property and 
        value pairs, where the property is separated from the value by a colon (:). Also, 
        property and value pairs are separated by commas. Discussed how properties whose value
        is a function is called a "method". In the last mini-project lesson of the class, we
        introduced to the window object and a few of its properties, including 
        windows.navigator, windows.geolocation, and window.location.href. Learned that the 
        functions alert, prompt and confirm are actually methods of the window object.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may recall that the gandalf object contained only properties (no methods), and 
        all property names were enclosed in quotes. In the car object, none of the 
        property names were enclosed in quotes, and the car object contained 4 methods: 
        honk(), driveToWork(), driveAroundWorld(), and tuneup(). We also used the while 
        statement in a student activity involving the car object.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- ######################################################################################### -->
<div id="week04">
    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <p>
        Week 4 focused on Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Specifically, it 
        focused on the window object and various of its properties, including navigator and 
        document.
    </p>

    <!-- ========================================================================================= -->
    <h3>First class of Week 4</h3>
    <p>
        First class of week 4 focused on the objects of the DOM, that the browser would create 
        a tree from the elements in a web page. We talked about the nodes in the tree, and the 
        relationships between parent nodes, child nodes, and sibling nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Objects from the DOM that were discussed included the Window, Node, Document, Element, NodeList, 
        and HTMLCollection objects. 
        We covered the Document.createElement() and Document.getElementById() methods.
        From the Node object, we covered the Node.textContent property and the Node.appendChild() 
        method.
        From the Element object, we covered the Element.children and Element.style properties, and the 
        Element.setAttribute(), Element.querySelector() and Element.querySelectorAll() methods.
        We also mentioned the NodeList and HTMLCollection objects.
        Finally, in the Speed Reader activity we covered the use of the setInterval() and clearInterval() 
        functions, which are actually methods of the Window object.
    </p>

    <!-- ========================================================================================= -->
    <h3>Second class of Week 4</h3>
    <p>
        The second class of week 4 focused on events, registering events, and stopping events. 
        We covered the Event.addEventListener(), Event.preventDefault(), and Event.stopPropagation() 
        methods. We practiced a bit of pseudo-coding as the second activity. We also mentioned 
        the Number.toFixed() method and parseFloat global function. The activities used the select, 
        textarea, input type="text" and input type="number" form fields. Of course we also used buttons.
        In addition, we covered the Array.forEach(), Array.includes(), and Arrray.push() methods. We 
        also used  the CSS display property to display/hide a modal dialog box.
    </p>

    <h3>First class of Week 5</h3>
    <p>
        This class was taught by Maximillian, as David was out of town to attend a funeral.
    </p>

    <!-- ========================================================================================= -->
    <h3>Second class of Week 5</h3>
    <p>
        The class ended with an introduction to the concept of scope.
    </p>

    <!-- ========================================================================================= -->
    <h3>Third class of Week 5</h3>
    <p>
        This class started with a review of the concept of scope. We reviewed code to see why 
        two very similar snippets of code were producing different alert statements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second half of the class focused on creating a jQuery calculator. It involved setting 
        event handlers for elements with the ".number" class, the ".operator" class, ".equals" class, 
        and ".clear" class.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="week06">
    <!-- ========================================================================================= -->
    <h3>First class of Week 6</h3>
    <p>
        This first class focused on the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format that many 
        JavaScript API's use to transfer data, and how to extract data from these JSON objects.
        We also looked at a few API's that returned data in JSON format, and how to request the data 
        with these API's and how to display the data returned to our webpage. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information about the JSON format, see the page <a target="_blank" 
        href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">https://www.json.org/json-en.html</a>by Douglas 
        Crockford, who invented the JSON format. Notice that according to the diagram on this web 
        page, a value can be a string, number, object, array, true, false, or null. It does not 
        specify undefined as a possible value. According to this webpage, property names must be 
        enclosed in double quotes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the API's we looked at were:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a target="_blank" 
            href="https://rapidapi.com/divad12/api/numbers-1">https://rapidapi.com/divad12/api/numbers-1</a> 
            This API can return interesting information about numbers, dates, years, and trivia.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a target="_blank" 
            href="https://www.faceplusplus.com/face-detection/">https://www.faceplusplus.com/face-detection/</a>
            Given the URL of an image, this API can recognize faces (not completely 100% accurate, as it recognized 
            a dog's face as a man's face), and indicate a probability that the face is that of a male or 
            female, the age of the person, the status of the left eye (open or closed), the status of the 
            right eye (again, open or closed), whether the person is wearing glasses, and whether the 
            person is smiling.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a target="_blank" 
            href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">http://www.omdbapi.com/</a> This API allows the user to search for 
            information about movies. We used this API to return information about a movie and append it to 
            a table in one of the activities.
